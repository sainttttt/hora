          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He sent amongst them diverse sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.</li>

          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they devoured all the grass in their land, * and consumed all the fruit of their ground.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he slew all the firstborn in their land: * the firstfruits of all their labour.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he brought them out with silver and gold: * and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.</li>

          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They asked, and the quail came: * and he filled them with the bread of heaven.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">He opened the rock, and waters flowed: * rivers ran down in the dry land.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Because he remembered his holy word, * which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen with gladness.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: * and they possessed the labours of the people:</li>

          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: * and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: * and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</li>

          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they believed his words: * and they sang his praises.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They had quickly done, they forgot his works: * and they waited not for his counsels.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they coveted their desire in the desert: * and they tempted God in the place without water.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he gave them their request: * and sent fulness into their souls.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they provoked Moses in the camp, * Aaron the holy one of the Lord.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: * and covered the congregation of Abiron.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And a fire was kindled in their congregation: * the flame burned the wicked.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They made also a calf in Horeb: * and they adored the graven thing.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they changed their glory * into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They forgot God, who saved them, * who had done great things in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he said that he would destroy them: * had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach:</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them; * and they set at nought the desirable land.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They believed not his word, and they murmured in their tents: * they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he lifted up his hand over them: * to overthrow them in the desert;</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And to cast down their seed among the nations, * and to scatter them in the countries.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They also were initiated to Beelphegor: * and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they provoked him with their inventions: * and destruction was multiplied among them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: * and the slaughter ceased.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And it was reputed to him unto justice, * to generation and generation for evermore.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: * and Moses was afflicted for their sakes: because they exasperated his spirit.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he distinguished with his lips; * they did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works: and served their idols, * and it became a stumblingblock to them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they sacrificed their sons, * and their daughters to devils.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And they shed innocent blood: * the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And the land was polluted with blood, and was defiled with their works: * and they went aside after their own inventions.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: * and he abhorred his inheritance.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: * and they that hated them had dominion over them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands: * many times did he deliver them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">But they provoked him with their counsel: * and they were brought low by their iniquities.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he saw when they were in tribulation: * and he heard their prayer.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he was mindful of his covenant: * and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">And he gave them unto mercies, * in the sight of all those that had made them.</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">Save us, O Lord, our God: * and gather us from among nations:</li>
        
          <li class="hanging-indent pb-2">That we may give thanks to thy holy name, * and may glory in thy praise.</li>
