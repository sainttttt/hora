## Introduction
  
_The Our Father, Hail Mary, and Apostles’ Creed are prayed silently._
      
  
          
  Pater noster, qui es in cælis, sanctificétur nomen tuum: advéniat regnum tuum: fiat volúntas tua, sicut in cælo et in terra. Panem nostrum quotidiánum da nobis hódie: et dimítte nobis débita nostra, sicut et nos dimíttimus debitóribus nostris: et ne nos indúcas in tentatiónem: sed líbera nos a malo. Amen.
          
  Ave María, grátia plena; Dóminus tecum: benedícta tu in muliéribus, et benedíctus fructus ventris tui Jesus. Sancta María, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatóribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ. Amen.
          
  Credo in Deum, Patrem omnipoténtem, Creatórem cæli et terræ. Et in Jesum Christum, Fílium ejus únicum, Dóminum nostrum: qui concéptus est de Spíritu Sancto, natus ex María Vírgine, passus sub Póntio Piláto, crucifíxus, mórtuus, et sepúltus: descéndit ad ínferos; tértia die resurréxit a mórtuis; ascéndit ad cælos; sedet ad déxteram Dei Patris omnipoténtis: inde ventúrus est judicáre vivos et mórtuos. Credo in Spíritum Sanctum, sanctam Ecclésiam cathólicam, Sanctórum communiónem, remissiónem peccatórum, carnis resurrectiónem, vitam ætérnam. Amen.
          
          
 Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.
          
 Hail Mary, full of grace; The Lord is with thee; Blessed art thou amongst women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
          
 I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried: he descended into hell; the third day he arose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven; sitteth at the right hand of God the Father almighty: from thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins. The resurrection of the body. And life everlasting. Amen.
          
      
      
      

    
  
## Psalmody
  

    
  
**Psalm 1**
      

    
  
Beátus vir, qui non ábiit in consílio impiórum, et in via peccatórum non stetit, * et in cáthedra pestiléntiæ non sedit:
          
Sed in lege Dómini volúntas eius, * et in lege eius meditábitur die ac nocte.
          
Et erit tamquam lignum, quod plantátum est secus decúrsus aquárum, * quod fructum suum dabit in témpore suo:
          
Et fólium eius non défluet: * et ómnia quæcúmque fáciet, prosperabúntur.
          
Non sic ímpii, non sic: * sed tamquam pulvis, quem proícit ventus a fácie terræ.
          
Ídeo non resúrgent ímpii in iudício: * neque peccatóres in concílio iustórum.
          
Quóniam novit Dóminus viam iustórum: * et iter impiórum períbit.
          
Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * nor sat in the chair of pestilence.
          
But his will is in the law of the Lord, * and on his law he shall meditate day and night.
          
And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, * which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season.
          
And his leaf shall not fall off: * and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.
          
Not so the wicked, not so: * but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.
          
Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.
          
For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.

**Psalm 2**
      

    
  
Quare fremuérunt gentes: * et pópuli meditáti sunt inánia?
          
Astitérunt reges terræ, et príncipes convenérunt in unum * advérsus Dóminum, et advérsus Christum eius.
          
Dirumpámus víncula eórum: * et proiciámus a nobis iugum ipsórum.
          
Qui hábitat in cælis, irridébit eos: * et Dóminus subsannábit eos.
          
Tunc loquétur ad eos in ira sua, * et in furóre suo conturbábit eos.
          
Ego autem constitútus sum Rex ab eo super Sion montem sanctum eius, * prǽdicans præcéptum eius.
          
Dóminus dixit ad me: * Fílius meus es tu, ego hódie génui te.
          
Póstula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditátem tuam, * et possessiónem tuam términos terræ.
          
Reges eos in virga férrea, * et tamquam vas fíguli confrínges eos.
          
Et nunc, reges, intellégite: * erudímini, qui iudicátis terram.
          
Servíte Dómino in timóre: * et exsultáte ei cum tremóre.
          
Apprehéndite disciplínam, nequándo irascátur Dóminus, * et pereátis de via iusta.
          
Cum exárserit in brevi ira eius: * beáti omnes qui confídunt in eo.
          
Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?
          
The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.
          
Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.
          
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.
          
Then shall he speak to them in his anger, * and trouble them in his rage.
          
But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.
          
The Lord hath said to me: * Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.
          
Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
          
Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, * and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
          
And now, O ye kings, understand: * receive instruction, you that judge the earth.
          
Serve ye the Lord with fear: * and rejoice unto him with trembling.
          
Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, * and you perish from the just way.
          
When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, * blessed are all they that trust in him.

**Psalm 3**
      

    
  
Dómine, quid multiplicáti sunt qui tríbulant me? * multi insúrgunt advérsum me.
          
Multi dicunt ánimæ meæ: * Non est salus ipsi in Deo eius.
          
Tu autem, Dómine, suscéptor meus es, * glória mea, et exáltans caput meum.
          
Voce mea ad Dóminum clamávi: * et exaudívit me de monte sancto suo.
          
Ego dormívi, et soporátus sum: * et exsurréxi, quia Dóminus suscépit me.
          
Non timébo míllia pópuli circumdántis me: * exsúrge, Dómine, salvum me fac, Deus meus.
          
Quóniam tu percussísti omnes adversántes mihi sine causa: * dentes peccatórum contrivísti.
          
Dómini est salus: * et super pópulum tuum benedíctio tua.
          
Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? * many are they who rise up against me.
          
Many say to my soul: * There is no salvation for him in his God.
          
But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
          
I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.
          
I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.
          
I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
          
For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: * thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
          
Salvation is of the Lord: * and thy blessing is upon thy people.

**Psalm 7**
      

    
  
Dómine, Deus meus, in te sperávi: * salvum me fac ex ómnibus persequéntibus me, et líbera me.
          
Nequándo rápiat ut leo ánimam meam, * dum non est qui rédimat, neque qui salvum fáciat.
          
Dómine, Deus meus, si feci istud, * si est iníquitas in mánibus meis:
          
Si réddidi retribuéntibus mihi mala, * décidam mérito ab inimícis meis inánis.
          
Persequátur inimícus ánimam meam, et comprehéndat, et concúlcet in terra vitam meam, * et glóriam meam in púlverem dedúcat.
          
Exsúrge, Dómine, in ira tua: * et exaltáre in fínibus inimicórum meórum.
          
Et exsúrge, Dómine, Deus meus, in præcépto quod mandásti: * et synagóga populórum circúmdabit te.
          
Et propter hanc in altum regrédere: * Dóminus júdicat pópulos.
          
Júdica me, Dómine, secúndum justítiam meam, * et secúndum innocéntiam meam super me.
          
Consumétur nequítia peccatórum, et díriges justum, * scrutans corda et renes, Deus.
          
Justum adjutórium meum a Dómino, * qui salvos facit rectos corde.
          
Deus judex justus, fortis, et pátiens: * numquid iráscitur per síngulos dies?
          
Nisi convérsi fuéritis, gládium suum vibrábit: * arcum suum teténdit, et parávit illum.
          
Et in eo parávit vasa mortis: * sagíttas suas ardéntibus effécit.
          
Ecce, partúriit injustítiam: * concépit dolórem, et péperit iniquitátem.
          
Lacum apéruit, et effódit eum: * et íncidit in fóveam quam fecit.
          
Convertétur dolor ejus in caput ejus: * et in vérticem ipsíus iníquitas ejus descéndet.
          
Confitébor Dómino secúndum justítiam ejus: * et psallam nómini Dómini altíssimi.
          
O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
          
Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, * while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.
          
O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, * if there be iniquity in my hands:
          
If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, * let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.
          
Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life on the earth, * and bring down my glory to the dust.
          
Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: * and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies.
          
And arise, O Lord my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded: * and a congregation of people shall surround thee.
          
And for their sakes return thou on high. * The Lord judgeth the people.
          
Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, * and according to my innocence in me.
          
The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and thou shalt direct the just: * the searcher of hearts and reins is God.
          
Just is my help from the Lord: * who saveth the upright of heart.
          
God is a just judge, strong and patient: * is he angry every day?
          
Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: * he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
          
And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, * he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.
          
Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
          
He hath opened a pit and dug it: * and he is fallen into the hole he made.
          
His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: * and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.
          
I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: * and will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.

**Psalm 20**
      

    
  
Dómine, in virtúte tua lætábitur rex: * ‡ et super salutáre tuum exsultábit veheménter.
          
Desidérium cordis eius tribuísti ei: * et voluntáte labiórum eius non fraudásti eum.
          
Quóniam prævenísti eum in benedictiónibus dulcédinis: * posuísti in cápite eius corónam de lápide pretióso.
          
Vitam pétiit a te: * et tribuísti ei longitúdinem diérum in sǽculum, et in sǽculum sǽculi.
          
Magna est glória eius in salutári tuo: * glóriam et magnum decórem impónes super eum.
          
Quóniam dabis eum in benedictiónem in sǽculum sǽculi: * lætificábis eum in gáudio cum vultu tuo.
          
Quóniam rex sperat in Dómino: * et in misericórdia Altíssimi non commovébitur.
          
Inveniátur manus tua ómnibus inimícis tuis: * déxtera tua invéniat omnes, qui te odérunt.
          
Pones eos ut clíbanum ignis in témpore vultus tui: * Dóminus in ira sua conturbábit eos, et devorábit eos ignis.
          
Fructum eórum de terra perdes: * et semen eórum a fíliis hóminum.
          
Quóniam declinavérunt in te mala: * cogitavérunt consília, quæ non potuérunt stabilíre.
          
Quóniam pones eos dorsum: * in relíquiis tuis præparábis vultum eórum.
          
Exaltáre, Dómine, in virtúte tua: * cantábimus et psallémus virtútes tuas.
          
The king rejoices in thy strength, O Lord; * ‡ and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly.
          
Thou hast given him his heart’s desire: * and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips.
          
For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: * thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
          
He asked life of thee: * and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.
          
His glory is great in thy salvation: * glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon him.
          
For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: * thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.
          
For the king hopeth in the Lord: * and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
          
Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: * let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.
          
Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, * in the time of thy anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour them.
          
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: * and their seed from among the children of men.
          
For they have intended evils against thee: * they have devised counsels which they have not been able to establish.
          
For thou shalt make them turn their back: * in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face.
          
Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: * we will sing and praise thy power.

**Psalm 34**
      

    
  
Iúdica, Dómine, nocéntes me, * expúgna impugnántes me.
          
Apprehénde arma et scutum: * et exsúrge in adiutórium mihi.
          
Effúnde frámeam, et conclúde advérsus eos, qui persequúntur me: * dic ánimæ meæ: Salus tua ego sum.
          
Confundántur et revereántur, * quæréntes ánimam meam.
          
Avertántur retrórsum, et confundántur * cogitántes mihi mala.
          
Fiant tamquam pulvis ante fáciem venti: * et Ángelus Dómini coárctans eos.
          
Fiat via illórum ténebræ et lúbricum: * et Ángelus Dómini pérsequens eos.
          
Quóniam gratis abscondérunt mihi intéritum láquei sui: * supervácue exprobravérunt ánimam meam.
          
Véniat illi láqueus, quem ignórat: et cáptio, quam abscóndit, apprehéndat eum: * et in láqueum cadat in ipsum.
          
Ánima autem mea exsultábit in Dómino: * et delectábitur super salutári suo.
          
Ómnia ossa mea dicent: * Dómine, quis símilis tibi?
          
Erípiens ínopem de manu fortiórum eius: * egénum et páuperem a diripiéntibus eum.
          
Surgéntes testes iníqui, * quæ ignorábam interrogábant me.
          
Retribuébant mihi mala pro bonis: * sterilitátem ánimæ meæ.
          
Ego autem cum mihi molésti essent, * induébar cilício.
          
Humiliábam in ieiúnio ánimam meam: * et orátio mea in sinu meo convertétur.
          
Quasi próximum, et quasi fratrem nostrum, sic complacébam: * quasi lugens et contristátus, sic humiliábar.
          
Et advérsum me lætáti sunt, et convenérunt: * congregáta sunt super me flagélla, et ignorávi.
          
Dissipáti sunt, nec compúncti, tentavérunt me, subsannavérunt me subsannatióne: * frenduérunt super me déntibus suis.
          
Dómine, quando respícies? * restítue ánimam meam a malignitáte eórum, a leónibus únicam meam.
          
Confitébor tibi in ecclésia magna, * in pópulo gravi laudábo te.
          
Non supergáudeant mihi qui adversántur mihi iníque: * qui odérunt me gratis et ánnuunt óculis.
          
Quóniam mihi quidem pacífice loquebántur: * et in iracúndia terræ loquéntes, dolos cogitábant.
          
Et dilatavérunt super me os suum: * dixérunt: Euge, euge, vidérunt óculi nostri.
          
Vidísti, Dómine, ne síleas: * Dómine, ne discédas a me.
          
Exsúrge et inténde iudício meo: * Deus meus, et Dóminus meus in causam meam.
          
Iúdica me secúndum iustítiam tuam, Dómine, Deus meus, * et non supergáudeant mihi.
          
Non dicant in córdibus suis: Euge, euge, ánimæ nostræ: * nec dicant: Devorávimus eum.
          
Erubéscant et revereántur simul, * qui gratulántur malis meis.
          
Induántur confusióne et reveréntia * qui magna loquúntur super me.
          
Exsúltent et læténtur qui volunt iustítiam meam: * et dicant semper: Magnificétur Dóminus qui volunt pacem servi eius.
          
Et lingua mea meditábitur iustítiam tuam, * tota die laudem tuam.
          
Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: * overthrow them that fight against me.
          
Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.
          
Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation.
          
Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.
          
Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.
          
Let them become as dust before the wind: * and let the Angel of the Lord straiten them.
          
Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.
          
For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.
          
Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.
          
But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.
          
All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?
          
Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; * the needy and the poor from them that strip him.
          
Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.
          
They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.
          
But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.
          
I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.
          
As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.
          
But they rejoiced against me, and came together: * scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.
          
They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
          
Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? * rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.
          
I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.
          
Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.
          
For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.
          
And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.
          
Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.
          
Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.
          
Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.
          
Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: * neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.
          
Let them blush: and be ashamed together, * who rejoice at my evils.
          
Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, * who speak great things against me.
          
Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, * and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.
          
And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, * thy praise all the day long.

**Psalm 68**
      

    
  
Salvum me fac, Deus: quóniam intravérunt aquæ usque ad ánimam meam.
          
‡ Infíxus sum in limo profúndi: * et non est substántia.
          
Veni in altitúdinem maris: * et tempéstas demérsit me.
          
Laborávi clamans, raucæ factæ sunt fauces meæ: * defecérunt óculi mei, dum spero in Deum meum.
          
Multiplicáti sunt super capíllos cápitis mei, * qui odérunt me gratis.
          
Confortáti sunt qui persecúti sunt me inimíci mei iniúste: * quæ non rápui, tunc exsolvébam.
          
Deus, tu scis insipiéntiam meam: * et delícta mea a te non sunt abscóndita.
          
Non erubéscant in me qui exspéctant te, Dómine, * Dómine virtútum.
          
Non confundántur super me * qui quǽrunt te, Deus Israël.
          
Quóniam propter te sustínui oppróbrium: * opéruit confúsio fáciem meam.
          
Extráneus factus sum frátribus meis, * et peregrínus fíliis matris meæ.
          
Quóniam zelus domus tuæ comédit me: * et oppróbria exprobrántium tibi cecidérunt super me.
          
Et opérui in ieiúnio ánimam meam: * et factum est in oppróbrium mihi.
          
Et pósui vestiméntum meum cilícium: * et factus sum illis in parábolam.
          
Advérsum me loquebántur, qui sedébant in porta: * et in me psallébant qui bibébant vinum.
          
Ego vero oratiónem meam ad te, Dómine: * tempus benepláciti, Deus.
          
In multitúdine misericórdiæ tuæ exáudi me, * in veritáte salútis tuæ:
          
Éripe me de luto, ut non infígar: * líbera me ab iis, qui odérunt me, et de profúndis aquárum.
          
Non me demérgat tempéstas aquæ, neque absórbeat me profúndum: * neque úrgeat super me púteus os suum.
          
Exáudi me, Dómine, quóniam benígna est misericórdia tua: * secúndum multitúdinem miseratiónum tuárum réspice in me.
          
Et ne avértas fáciem tuam a púero tuo: * quóniam tríbulor, velóciter exáudi me.
          
Inténde ánimæ meæ, et líbera eam: * propter inimícos meos éripe me.
          
Tu scis impropérium meum, et confusiónem meam, * et reveréntiam meam.
          
In conspéctu tuo sunt omnes qui tríbulant me: * impropérium exspectávit cor meum, et misériam.
          
Et sustínui qui simul contristarétur, et non fuit: * et qui consolarétur, et non invéni.
          
Et dedérunt in escam meam fel: * et in siti mea potavérunt me acéto.
          
Fiat mensa eórum coram ipsis in láqueum, * et in retributiónes, et in scándalum.
          
Obscuréntur óculi eórum ne vídeant: * et dorsum eórum semper incúrva.
          
Effúnde super eos iram tuam: * et furor iræ tuæ comprehéndat eos.
          
Fiat habitátio eórum desérta: * et in tabernáculis eórum non sit qui inhábitet.
          
Quóniam quem tu percussísti, persecúti sunt: * et super dolórem vúlnerum meórum addidérunt.
          
Appóne iniquitátem super iniquitátem eórum: * et non intrent in iustítiam tuam.
          
Deleántur de libro vivéntium: * et cum iustis non scribántur.
          
Ego sum pauper et dolens: * salus tua, Deus, suscépit me.
          
Laudábo nomen Dei cum cántico: * et magnificábo eum in laude:
          
Et placébit Deo super vítulum novéllum: * córnua producéntem et úngulas.
          
Vídeant páuperes et læténtur: * quǽrite Deum, et vivet ánima vestra.
          
Quóniam exaudívit páuperes Dóminus: * et vinctos suos non despéxit.
          
Laudent illum cæli et terra, * mare et ómnia reptília in eis.
          
Quóniam Deus salvam fáciet Sion: * et ædificabúntur civitátes Iuda.
          
Et inhabitábunt ibi, * et hereditáte acquírent eam.
          
Et semen servórum eius possidébit eam: * et qui díligunt nomen eius, habitábunt in ea.
          
Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.
          
‡ I stick fast in the mire of the deep: * and there is no sure standing.
          
I am come into the depth of the sea: * and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
          
I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: * my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.
          
They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, * who hate me without cause.
          
My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: * then did I pay that which I took not away.
          
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; * and my offences are not hidden from thee.
          
Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, * the Lord of hosts.
          
Let them not be confounded on my account, * who seek thee, O God of Israel.
          
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; * shame hath covered my face.
          
I am become a stranger to my brethren, * and an alien to the sons of my mother.
          
For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: * and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
          
And I covered my soul in fasting: * and it was made a reproach to me.
          
And I made haircloth my garment: * and I became a byword to them.
          
They that sat in the gate spoke against me: * and they that drank wine made me their song.
          
But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; * for the time of thy good pleasure, O God.
          
In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, * in the truth of thy salvation.
          
Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: * deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
          
Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
          
Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; * look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
          
And turn not away thy face from thy servant: * for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
          
Attend to my soul, and deliver it: * save me because of my enemies.
          
Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, * and my shame.
          
In thy sight are all they that afflict me; * my heart hath expected reproach and misery.
          
And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, * but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
          
And they gave me gall for my food, * and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
          
Let their table become as a snare before them, * and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.
          
Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; * and their back bend thou down always.
          
Pour out thy indignation upon them: * and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
          
Let their habitation be made desolate: * and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
          
Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; * and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
          
Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: * and let them not come into thy justice.
          
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; * and with the just let them not be written.
          
I am poor and sorrowful: * thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.
          
I will praise the name of God with a canticle: * and I will magnify him with praise.
          
And it shall please God better than a young calf, * that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.
          
Let the poor see and rejoice: * seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
          
For the Lord hath heard the poor: * and hath not despised his prisoners.
          
Let the heavens and the earth praise him; * the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.
          
For God will save Sion, * and the cities of Juda shall be built up.
          
And they shall dwell there, * and acquire it by inheritance.
          
And the seed of his servants shall possess it; * and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

**Psalm 77**
      

    
  
Atténdite, pópule meus, legem meam: * inclináte aurem vestram in verba oris mei.
          
Apériam in parábolis os meum: * loquar propositiónes ab inítio.
          
Quanta audívimus et cognóvimus ea: * et patres nostri narravérunt nobis.
          
Non sunt occultáta a fíliis eórum: * in generatióne áltera.
          
Narrántes laudes Dómini, et virtútes ejus: * et mirabília ejus, quæ fecit.
          
Et suscitávit testimónium in Jacob: * et legem pósuit in Israël.
          
Quanta mandávit pátribus nostris nota fácere ea fíliis suis: * ut cognóscat generátio áltera.
          
Fílii qui nascéntur, et exsúrgent, * et narrábunt fíliis suis.
          
Ut ponant in Deo spem suam, et non obliviscántur óperum Dei: * et mandáta ejus exquírant.
          
Ne fiant sicut patres eórum: * generátio prava et exásperans.
          
Generátio, quæ non diréxit cor suum: * et non est créditus cum Deo spíritus ejus.
          
Fílii Ephrem intendéntes et mitténtes arcum: * convérsi sunt in die belli.
          
Non custodiérunt testaméntum Dei: * et in lege ejus noluérunt ambuláre.
          
Et oblíti sunt benefactórum ejus: * et mirabílium ejus quæ osténdit eis.
          
Coram pátribus eórum fecit mirabília in terra Ægýpti: * in campo Táneos.
          
Interrúpit mare, et perdúxit eos: * et státuit aquas quasi in utre.
          
Et dedúxit eos in nube diéi: * et tota nocte in illuminatióne ignis.
          
Interrúpit petram in erémo: * et adaquávit eos velut in abýsso multa.
          
Et edúxit aquam de petra: * et dedúxit tamquam flúmina aquas.
          
Et apposuérunt adhuc peccáre ei: * in iram excitavérunt Excélsum in inaquóso.
          
Et tentavérunt Deum in córdibus suis, * ut péterent escas animábus suis.
          
Et male locúti sunt de Deo: * dixérunt: Numquid póterit Deus paráre mensam in desérto?
          
Quóniam percússit petram, et fluxérunt aquæ: * et torréntes inundavérunt.
          
Numquid et panem póterit dare, * aut paráre mensam pópulo suo?
          
Ídeo audívit Dóminus, et dístulit: * et ignis accénsus est in Jacob, et ira ascéndit in Israël.
          
Quia non credidérunt in Deo: * nec speravérunt in salutári ejus:
          
Et mandávit núbibus désuper: * et jánuas cæli apéruit.
          
Et pluit illis manna ad manducándum: * et panem cæli dedit eis.
          
Panem Angelórum manducávit homo, * cibária misit eis in abundántia.
          
Tránstulit Austrum de cælo: * et indúxit in virtúte sua Áfricum.
          
Et pluit super eos sicut púlverem carnes: * et sicut arénam maris volatília pennáta.
          
Et cecidérunt in médio castrórum eórum: * circa tabernácula eórum.
          
Et manducavérunt, et saturáti sunt nimis, et desidérium eórum áttulit eis: * non sunt fraudáti a desidério suo.
          
Adhuc escæ eórum erant in ore ipsórum: * et ira Dei ascéndit super eos.
          
Et occídit pingues eórum, * et eléctos Israël impedívit.
          
In ómnibus his peccavérunt adhuc: * et non credidérunt in mirabílibus ejus.
          
Et defecérunt in vanitáte dies eórum: * et anni eórum cum festinatióne.
          
Cum occíderet eos, quærébant eum: * et revertebántur, et dilúculo veniébant ad eum.
          
Et rememoráti sunt quia Deus adjútor est eórum: * et Deus excélsus redémptor eórum est.
          
Et dilexérunt eum in ore suo, * et lingua sua mentíti sunt ei.
          
Cor autem eórum non erat rectum cum eo: * nec fidéles hábiti sunt in testaménto ejus.
          
Ipse autem est miséricors, et propítius fiet peccátis eórum: * et non dispérdet eos.
          
Et abundávit ut avérteret iram suam: * et non accéndit omnem iram suam:
          
Et recordátus est quia caro sunt: * spíritus vadens et non rédiens.
          
Quóties exacerbavérunt eum in desérto, * in iram concitavérunt eum in inaquóso?
          
Et convérsi sunt, et tentavérunt Deum: * et Sanctum Israël exacerbavérunt.
          
Non sunt recordáti manus ejus, * die qua redémit eos de manu tribulántis.
          
Sicut pósuit in Ægýpto signa sua, * et prodígia sua in campo Táneos.
          
Et convértit in sánguinem flúmina eórum: * et imbres eórum, ne bíberent.
          
Misit in eos cœnomyíam, et comédit eos: * et ranam, et dispérdidit eos.
          
Et dedit ærúgini fructus eórum: * et labóres eórum locústæ.
          
Et occídit in grándine víneas eórum: * et moros eórum in pruína.
          
Et trádidit grándini juménta eórum: * et possessiónem eórum igni.
          
Misit in eos iram indignatiónis suæ: * indignatiónem, et iram, et tribulatiónem: immissiónes per ángelos malos.
          
Viam fecit sémitæ iræ suæ, non pepércit a morte animábus eórum: * et juménta eórum in morte conclúsit.
          
Et percússit omne primogénitum in terra Ægýpti: * primítias omnis labóris eórum in tabernáculis Cham.
          
Et ábstulit sicut oves pópulum suum: * et perdúxit eos tamquam gregem in desérto.
          
Et dedúxit eos in spe, et non timuérunt: * et inimícos eórum opéruit mare.
          
Et indúxit eos in montem sanctificatiónis suæ: * montem, quem acquisívit déxtera ejus.
          
Et ejécit a fácie eórum gentes: * et sorte divísit eis terram in funículo distributiónis.
          
Et habitáre fecit in tabernáculis eórum: * tribus Israël.
          
Et tentavérunt, et exacerbavérunt Deum excélsum: * et testimónia ejus non custodiérunt.
          
Et avertérunt se, et non servavérunt pactum: * quemádmodum patres eórum convérsi sunt in arcum pravum.
          
In iram concitavérunt eum in cóllibus suis: * et in sculptílibus suis ad æmulatiónem eum provocavérunt.
          
Audívit Deus, et sprevit: * et ad níhilum redégit valde Israël.
          
Et répulit tabernáculum Silo: * tabernáculum suum, ubi habitávit in homínibus.
          
Et trádidit in captivitátem virtútem eórum: * et pulchritúdinem eórum in manus inimíci.
          
Et conclúsit in gládio pópulum suum: * et hereditátem suam sprevit.
          
Júvenes eórum comédit ignis: * et vírgines eórum non sunt lamentátæ.
          
Sacerdótes eórum in gládio cecidérunt: * et víduæ eórum non plorabántur.
          
Et excitátus est tamquam dórmiens Dóminus: * tamquam potens crapulátus a vino.
          
Et percússit inimícos suos in posterióra: * oppróbrium sempitérnum dedit illis.
          
Et répulit tabernáculum Joseph: * et tribum Éphraim non elégit.
          
Sed elégit tribum Juda, * montem Sion quem diléxit.
          
Et ædificávit sicut unicórnium sanctifícium suum in terra, * quam fundávit in sǽcula.
          
Et elégit David, servum suum, et sústulit eum de grégibus óvium: * de post fœtántes accépit eum,
          
Páscere Jacob, servum suum, * et Israël, hereditátem suam:
          
Et pavit eos in innocéntia cordis sui: * et in intelléctibus mánuum suárum dedúxit eos.
          
Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
          
I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.
          
How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.
          
They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.
          
Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.
          
And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.
          
How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.
          
The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.
          
That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.
          
That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse and exasperating generation.
          
A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
          
The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.
          
They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.
          
And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.
          
Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.
          
He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.
          
And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.
          
He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.
          
He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.
          
And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.
          
And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.
          
And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
          
Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.
          
Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?
          
Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.
          
Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.
          
And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.
          
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.
          
Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.
          
He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.
          
And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
          
And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.
          
So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.
          
As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.
          
And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.
          
In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.
          
And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.
          
When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.
          
And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.
          
And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:
          
But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.
          
But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.
          
And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.
          
And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.
          
How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?
          
And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.
          
They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:
          
How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.
          
And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.
          
He sent amongst them diverse sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.
          
And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.
          
And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.
          
And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.
          
And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.
          
He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.
          
And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.
          
And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
          
And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
          
And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.
          
And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.
          
And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.
          
Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.
          
And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.
          
They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.
          
God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.
          
And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.
          
And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.
          
And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.
          
Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.
          
Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.
          
And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.
          
And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.
          
And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
          
But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.
          
And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.
          
And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,
          
To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.
          
And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: * and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.

**Psalm 78**
      

    
  
Deus, venérunt gentes in hereditátem tuam, polluérunt templum sanctum tuum: * posuérunt Ierúsalem in pomórum custódiam.
          
Posuérunt morticína servórum tuórum, escas volatílibus cæli: * carnes sanctórum tuórum béstiis terræ.
          
Effudérunt sánguinem eórum tamquam aquam in circúitu Ierúsalem: * et non erat qui sepelíret.
          
Facti sumus oppróbrium vicínis nostris: * subsannátio et illúsio his, qui in circúitu nostro sunt.
          
Úsquequo, Dómine, irascéris in finem: * accendétur velut ignis zelus tuus?
          
Effúnde iram tuam in gentes, quæ te non novérunt: * et in regna quæ nomen tuum non invocavérunt:
          
Quia comedérunt Iacob: * et locum eius desolavérunt.
          
Ne memíneris iniquitátum nostrárum antiquárum, cito antícipent nos misericórdiæ tuæ: * quia páuperes facti sumus nimis.
          
Ádiuva nos, Deus, salutáris noster: et propter glóriam nóminis tui, Dómine, líbera nos: * et propítius esto peccátis nostris, propter nomen tuum:
          
Ne forte dicant in géntibus: Ubi est Deus eórum? * et innotéscat in natiónibus coram óculis nostris.
          
Últio sánguinis servórum tuórum, qui effúsus est: * intróeat in conspéctu tuo gémitus compeditórum.
          
Secúndum magnitúdinem brácchii tui, * pósside fílios mortificatórum.
          
Et redde vicínis nostris séptuplum in sinu eórum: * impropérium ipsórum, quod exprobravérunt tibi, Dómine.
          
Nos autem pópulus tuus, et oves páscuæ tuæ, * confitébimur tibi in sǽculum.
          
In generatiónem et generatiónem * annuntiábimus laudem tuam.
          
O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: * they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.
          
They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: * the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
          
They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem, * and there was none to bury them.
          
We are become a reproach to our neighbours: * a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
          
How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: * shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?
          
Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
          
Because they have devoured Jacob; * and have laid waste his place.
          
Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, * for we are become exceeding poor.
          
Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: * and forgive us our sins for thy name’s sake:
          
Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? * And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes,
          
By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed: * let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee.
          
According to the greatness of thy arm, * take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.
          
And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: * the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
          
But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, * will give thanks to thee for ever.
          
We will shew forth thy praise, * unto generation and generation.

**Psalm 82**
      

    
  
Deus, quis símilis erit tibi? * Ne táceas, neque compescáris, Deus.
          
Quóniam ecce inimíci tui sonuérunt: * et qui odérunt te extulérunt caput.
          
Super pópulum tuum malignavérunt consílium: * et cogitavérunt advérsus sanctos tuos.
          
Dixérunt: Veníte, et disperdámus eos de gente: * et non memorétur nomen Israël ultra.
          
Quóniam cogitavérunt unanímiter: * simul advérsum te testaméntum disposuérunt, tabernácula Idumæórum et Ismahelítæ:
          
Moab, et Agaréni, Gebal, et Ammon, et Ámalec: * alienígenæ cum habitántibus Tyrum.
          
Étenim Assur venit cum illis: * facti sunt in adiutórium fíliis Lot.
          
Fac illis sicut Mádian, et Sísaræ: * sicut Iabin in torrénte Cisson.
          
Disperiérunt in Endor: * facti sunt ut stercus terræ.
          
Pone príncipes eórum sicut Oreb, et Zeb, * et Zébee, et Sálmana:
          
Omnes príncipes eórum: * qui dixérunt: Hereditáte possideámus Sanctuárium Dei.
          
Deus meus, pone illos ut rotam: * et sicut stípulam ante fáciem venti.
          
Sicut ignis, qui combúrit silvam: * et sicut flamma combúrens montes:
          
Ita persequéris illos in tempestáte tua: * et in ira tua turbábis eos.
          
Imple fácies eórum ignomínia: * et quǽrent nomen tuum, Dómine.
          
Erubéscant, et conturbéntur in sǽculum sǽculi: * et confundántur, et péreant.
          
Et cognóscant quia nomen tibi Dóminus: * tu solus Altíssimus in omni terra.
          
O God, who shall be like to thee? * Hold not thy peace, neither be O God, thou still,
          
For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: * and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
          
They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, * and have consulted against thy saints.
          
They have said: Come and let us destroy them, * so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.
          
For they have contrived with one consent: * they have made a covenant together against thee; the tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites:
          
Moab, and the Agarens, Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: * the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
          
Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: * they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.
          
Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: * as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson.
          
Who perished at Endor: * and became as dung for the earth.
          
Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, * and Zebee, and Salmana.
          
All their princes, * who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.
          
O my God, make them like a wheel; * and as stubble before the wind.
          
As fire which burneth the wood: * and as a flame burning mountains:
          
So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: * and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.
          
Fill their faces with shame; * and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
          
Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: * and let them be confounded and perish.
          
And let them know that the Lord is thy name: * thou alone art the most High over all the earth.

Confitémini Dómino, et invocáte nomen ejus: * annuntiáte inter gentes ópera ejus.
          
Cantáte ei, et psállite ei: * narráte ómnia mirabília ejus.
          
Laudámini in nómine sancto ejus: * lætétur cor quæréntium Dóminum.
          
Quǽrite Dóminum, et confirmámini: * quǽrite fáciem ejus semper.
          
Mementóte mirabílium ejus, quæ fecit: * prodígia ejus, et judícia oris ejus.
          
Semen Ábraham, servi ejus: * fílii Jacob, elécti ejus.
          
Ipse Dóminus Deus noster: * in univérsa terra judícia ejus.
          
Memor fuit in sǽculum testaménti sui: * verbi, quod mandávit in mille generatiónes:
          
Quod dispósuit ad Ábraham: * et juraménti sui ad Isaac:
          
Et státuit illud Jacob in præcéptum: * et Israël in testaméntum ætérnum:
          
Dicens: Tibi dabo terram Chánaan, * funículum hereditátis vestræ.
          
Cum essent número brevi, * paucíssimi et íncolæ ejus:
          
Et pertransiérunt de gente in gentem, * et de regno ad pópulum álterum.
          
Non relíquit hóminem nocére eis: * et corrípuit pro eis reges.
          
Nolíte tángere christos meos: * et in prophétis meis nolíte malignári.
          
Et vocávit famem super terram: * et omne firmaméntum panis contrívit.
          
Misit ante eos virum: * in servum venúmdatus est Joseph.
          
Humiliavérunt in compédibus pedes ejus, ferrum pertránsiit ánimam ejus * donec veníret verbum ejus.
          
Elóquium Dómini inflammávit eum: * misit rex, et solvit eum; princeps populórum, et dimísit eum.
          
Constítuit eum dóminum domus suæ: * et príncipem omnis possessiónis suæ:
          
Ut erudíret príncipes ejus sicut semetípsum: * et senes ejus prudéntiam docéret.
          
Et intrávit Israël in Ægýptum: * et Jacob áccola fuit in terra Cham.
          
Et auxit pópulum suum veheménter: * et firmávit eum super inimícos ejus.
          
Convértit cor eórum ut odírent pópulum ejus: * et dolum fácerent in servos ejus.
          
Misit Móysen, servum suum: * Aaron, quem elégit ipsum.
          
Pósuit in eis verba signórum suórum: * et prodigiórum in terra Cham.
          
Misit ténebras, et obscurávit: * et non exacerbávit sermónes suos.
          
Convértit aquas eórum in sánguinem: * et occídit pisces eórum.
          
Édidit terra eórum ranas: * in penetrálibus regum ipsórum.
          
Dixit, et venit cœnomyía: * et cínifes in ómnibus fínibus eórum.
          
Pósuit plúvias eórum grándinem: * ignem comburéntem in terra ipsórum.
          
Et percússit víneas eórum, et ficúlneas eórum: * et contrívit lignum fínium eórum.
          
Dixit, et venit locústa, et bruchus, * cujus non erat númerus:
          
Et comédit omne fænum in terra eórum: * et comédit omnem fructum terræ eórum.
          
Et percússit omne primogénitum in terra eórum: * primítias omnis labóris eórum.
          
Et edúxit eos cum argénto et auro: * et non erat in tríbubus eórum infírmus.
          
Lætáta est Ægýptus in profectióne eórum: * quia incúbuit timor eórum super eos.
          
Expándit nubem in protectiónem eórum: * et ignem ut lucéret eis per noctem.
          
Petiérunt, et venit cotúrnix: * et pane cæli saturávit eos.
          
Dirúpit petram et fluxérunt aquæ: * abiérunt in sicco flúmina;
          
Quóniam memor fuit verbi sancti sui: * quod hábuit ad Ábraham, púerum suum.
          
Et edúxit pópulum suum in exsultatióne, * et eléctos suos in lætítia.
          
Et dedit illis regiónes géntium: * et labóres populórum possedérunt:
          
Ut custódiant justificatiónes ejus, * et legem ejus requírant.
          
Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: * declare his deeds among the Gentiles.
          
Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: * relate all his wondrous works.
          
Glory ye in his holy name: * let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
          
Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened: * seek his face evermore.
          
Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; * his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.
          
O ye seed of Abraham his servant; * ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
          
He is the Lord our God: * his judgments are in all the earth.
          
He hath remembered his covenant for ever: * the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
          
Which he made to Abraham; * and his oath to Isaac:
          
And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, * and to Israel for an everlasting testament:
          
Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, * the lot of your inheritance.
          
When they were but a small number: * yea very few, and sojourners therein:
          
And they passed from nation to nation, * and from one kingdom to another people.
          
He suffered no man to hurt them: * and he reproved kings for their sakes.
          
Touch ye not my anointed: * and do no evil to my prophets.
          
And he called a famine upon the land: * and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.
          
He sent a man before them: * Joseph, who was sold for a slave.
          
They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul, * until his word came.
          
The word of the Lord inflamed him: * the king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.
          
He made him master of his house, * and ruler of all his possession.
          
That he might instruct his princes as himself, * and teach his ancients wisdom.
          
And Israel went into Egypt: * and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.
          
And he increased his people exceedingly: * and strengthened them over their enemies,
          
He turned their heart to hate his people: * and to deal deceitfully with his servants.
          
He sent Moses his servant: * Aaron the man whom he had chosen.
          
He gave them power to shew his signs, * and his wonders in the land of Cham.
          
He sent darkness, and made it obscure: * and grieved not his words.
          
He turned their waters into blood, * and destroyed their fish.
          
Their land brought forth frogs, * in the inner chambers of their kings.
          
He spoke, and there came diverse sorts of flies, * and sciniphs in all their coasts.
          
He gave them hail for rain, * a burning fire in the land.
          
And he destroyed their vineyards, and their fig trees: * and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.
          
He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, * of which there was no number.
          
And they devoured all the grass in their land, * and consumed all the fruit of their ground.
          
And he slew all the firstborn in their land: * the firstfruits of all their labour.
          
And he brought them out with silver and gold: * and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.
          
Egypt was glad when they departed: * for the fear of them lay upon them.
          
He spread a cloud for their protection, * and fire to give them light in the night.
          
They asked, and the quail came: * and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
          
He opened the rock, and waters flowed: * rivers ran down in the dry land.
          
Because he remembered his holy word, * which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.
          
And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen with gladness.
          
And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: * and they possessed the labours of the people:
          
That they might observe his justifications, * and seek after his law.

Confitémini Dómino, quóniam bonus: * quóniam in sǽculum misericórdia ejus.
          
Quis loquétur poténtias Dómini, * audítas fáciet omnes laudes ejus?
          
Beáti, qui custódiunt judícium, * et fáciunt justítiam in omni témpore.
          
Meménto nostri, Dómine, in beneplácito pópuli tui: * vísita nos in salutári tuo:
          
Ad vidéndum in bonitáte electórum tuórum, ad lætándum in lætítia gentis tuæ: * ut laudéris cum hereditáte tua.
          
Peccávimus cum pátribus nostris: * injúste égimus, iniquitátem fécimus.
          
Patres nostri in Ægýpto non intellexérunt mirabília tua: * non fuérunt mémores multitúdinis misericórdiæ tuæ.
          
Et irritavérunt ascendéntes in mare, * Mare Rubrum.
          
Et salvávit eos propter nomen suum: * ut notam fáceret poténtiam suam.
          
Et incrépuit Mare Rubrum, et exsiccátum est, * et dedúxit eos in abýssis sicut in desérto.
          
Et salvávit eos de manu odiéntium: * et redémit eos de manu inimíci.
          
Et opéruit aqua tribulántes eos: * unus ex eis non remánsit.
          
Et credidérunt verbis ejus: * et laudavérunt laudem ejus.
          
Cito fecérunt, oblíti sunt óperum ejus: * et non sustinuérunt consílium ejus.
          
Et concupiérunt concupiscéntiam in desérto: * et tentavérunt Deum in inaquóso.
          
Et dedit eis petitiónem ipsórum: * et misit saturitátem in ánimas eórum.
          
Et irritavérunt Moysen in castris: * Aaron, sanctum Dómini.
          
Apérta est terra, et deglutívit Dathan: * et opéruit super congregatiónem Abíron.
          
Et exársit ignis in synagóga eórum * flamma combússit peccatóres.
          
Et fecérunt vítulum in Horeb * et adoravérunt scúlptile.
          
Et mutavérunt glóriam suam * in similitúdinem vítuli comedéntis fænum.
          
Oblíti sunt Deum, qui salvávit eos, * qui fecit magnália in Ægýpto, mirabília in terra Cham: terribília in Mari Rubro.
          
Et dixit ut dispérderet eos: * si non Móyses, eléctus ejus, stetísset in confractióne in conspéctu ejus:
          
Ut avérteret iram ejus ne dispérderet eos: * et pro níhilo habuérunt terram desiderábilem:
          
Non credidérunt verbo ejus, et murmuravérunt in tabernáculis suis: * non exaudiérunt vocem Dómini.
          
Et elevávit manum suam super eos: * ut prostérneret eos in desérto:
          
Et ut deíceret semen eórum in natiónibus: * et dispérgeret eos in regiónibus.
          
Et initiáti sunt Beélphegor: * et comedérunt sacrifícia mortuórum.
          
Et irritavérunt eum in adinventiónibus suis: * et multiplicáta est in eis ruína.
          
Et stetit Phínees, et placávit: * et cessávit quassátio.
          
Et reputátum est ei in justítiam: * in generatiónem et generatiónem usque in sempitérnum.
          
Et irritavérunt eum ad aquas contradictiónis: * et vexátus est Móyses propter eos: quia exacerbavérunt spíritum ejus.
          
Et distínxit in lábiis suis: * non disperdidérunt gentes, quas dixit Dóminus illis.
          
Et commísti sunt inter gentes, et didicérunt ópera eórum: et serviérunt sculptílibus eórum: * et factum est illis in scándalum.
          
Et immolavérunt fílios suos, * et fílias suas dæmóniis.
          
Et effudérunt sánguinem innocéntem: * sánguinem filiórum suórum et filiárum suárum, quas sacrificavérunt sculptílibus Chánaan.
          
Et infécta est terra in sanguínibus, et contamináta est in opéribus eórum: * et fornicáti sunt in adinventiónibus suis.
          
Et irátus est furóre Dóminus in pópulum suum: * et abominátus est hereditátem suam.
          
Et trádidit eos in manus géntium: * et domináti sunt eórum qui odérunt eos.
          
Et tribulavérunt eos inimíci eórum, et humiliáti sunt sub mánibus eórum: * sæpe liberávit eos.
          
Ipsi autem exacerbavérunt eum in consílio suo: * et humiliáti sunt in iniquitátibus suis.
          
Et vidit, cum tribularéntur: * et audívit oratiónem eórum.
          
Et memor fuit testaménti sui: * et pœnítuit eum secúndum multitúdinem misericórdiæ suæ.
          
Et dedit eos in misericórdias * in conspéctu ómnium qui céperant eos.
          
Salvos nos fac, Dómine, Deus noster: * et cóngrega nos de natiónibus:
          
Ut confiteámur nómini sancto tuo: * et gloriémur in laude tua.
          
Benedíctus Dóminus, Deus Israël, a sǽculo et usque in sǽculum: * et dicet omnis pópulus: Fiat, fiat.
          
Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
          
Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? * who shall set forth all his praises?
          
Blessed are they that keep judgment, * and do justice at all times.
          
Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: * visit us with thy salvation.
          
That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: * that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.
          
We have sinned with our fathers: * we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.
          
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: * they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies:
          
And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, * even the Red Sea.
          
And he saved them for his own name’s sake: * that he might make his power known.
          
And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: * and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.
          
And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: * and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
          
And the water covered them that afflicted them: * there was not one of them left.
          
And they believed his words: * and they sang his praises.
          
They had quickly done, they forgot his works: * and they waited not for his counsels.
          
And they coveted their desire in the desert: * and they tempted God in the place without water.
          
And he gave them their request: * and sent fulness into their souls.
          
And they provoked Moses in the camp, * Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
          
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: * and covered the congregation of Abiron.
          
And a fire was kindled in their congregation: * the flame burned the wicked.
          
They made also a calf in Horeb: * and they adored the graven thing.
          
And they changed their glory * into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.
          
They forgot God, who saved them, * who had done great things in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.
          
And he said that he would destroy them: * had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach:
          
To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them; * and they set at nought the desirable land.
          
They believed not his word, and they murmured in their tents: * they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
          
And he lifted up his hand over them: * to overthrow them in the desert;
          
And to cast down their seed among the nations, * and to scatter them in the countries.
          
They also were initiated to Beelphegor: * and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
          
And they provoked him with their inventions: * and destruction was multiplied among them.
          
Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: * and the slaughter ceased.
          
And it was reputed to him unto justice, * to generation and generation for evermore.
          
They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: * and Moses was afflicted for their sakes: because they exasperated his spirit.
          
And he distinguished with his lips; * they did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.
          
And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works: and served their idols, * and it became a stumblingblock to them.
          
And they sacrificed their sons, * and their daughters to devils.
          
And they shed innocent blood: * the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan.
          
And the land was polluted with blood, and was defiled with their works: * and they went aside after their own inventions.
          
And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: * and he abhorred his inheritance.
          
And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: * and they that hated them had dominion over them.
          
And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands: * many times did he deliver them.
          
But they provoked him with their counsel: * and they were brought low by their iniquities.
          
And he saw when they were in tribulation: * and he heard their prayer.
          
And he was mindful of his covenant: * and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
          
And he gave them unto mercies, * in the sight of all those that had made them.
          
Save us, O Lord, our God: * and gather us from among nations:
          
That we may give thanks to thy holy name, * and may glory in thy praise.
          
Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: * and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.

  Réspice, quǽsumus, Dómine, super hanc famíliam tuam, pro qua Dóminus noster Jesus Christus non dubitávit mánibus tradi nocéntium, et crucis subíre torméntum:
          
          
 Look down, we beseech thee, O Lord, on this thy family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ did not hesitate to be delivered up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer the torment of the Cross.
