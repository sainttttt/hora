_The Our Father and Hail Mary are prayed silently._
      
  
      
      
        
 Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.
        
 Hail Mary, full of grace; The Lord is with thee; Blessed art thou amongst women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
        
      

    
  
## Psalmody
  

      

      
_Ant._ The Lord hath heard * my supplication: the Lord hath received my prayer.
        

    
    
  

    
  
**Psalm 39:2–9**
      

    
  

      

      
        
With expectation I have waited for the Lord, * and he was attentive to me.
        
And he heard my prayers, * and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs.
        
And he set my feet upon a rock, * and directed my steps.
        
And he put a new canticle into my mouth, * a song to our God.
        
Many shall see, and shall fear: * and they shall hope in the Lord.
        
Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; * and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.
        
Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: * and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee.
        
I have declared and I have spoken * they are multiplied above number.
        
Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; * but thou hast pierced ears for me.
        
Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require: * then said I, Behold I come.
        
In the head of the book it is written of me that I should do thy will: * O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
        
      

    
  

      

      
        
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
        
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.
        
      

    
  

    
  
**Psalm 39:10–14**
      

    
  

      

      
        
I have declared thy justice in a great church, * lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.
        
I have not hid thy justice within my heart: * I have declared thy truth and thy salvation.
        
I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth * from a great council.
        
Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: * thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
        
For evils without number have surrounded me; * my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see.
        
They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: * and my heart hath forsaken me.
        
Be pleased, O Lord to deliver me: * look down, O Lord, to help me.
        
      

    
  

      

      
        
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
        
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.
        
      

    
  

    
  
**Psalm 39:15–18**
      

    
  

      

      
        
Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul * to take it away.
        
Let them be turned backward and be ashamed * that desire evils to me.
        
Let them immediately bear their confusion, * that say to me: ’Tis well, ’tis well.
        
Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
        
But I am a beggar and poor: * the Lord is careful for me.
        
Thou art my helper and my protector: * O my God, be not slack.
        
      

    
  

      

      
        
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
        
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.
        
      

    
  

    
  

      

      
_Ant._ The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my prayer.
        

    
    
  

    
  
## Antiphon
  
      
      
        
 How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God.
        
      

    
  

    
  
_The Our Father is prayed silently._
      
  
      
      
        
 Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.
        
      

    
  
**Psalm 12**
      

    
  

    
  
_The psalm is prayed in a lower voice._
      
  

      

      
        
How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? * how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?
        
How long shall I take counsels in my soul, * sorrow in my heart all the day?
        
How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? * Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God.
        
Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death: * lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him.
        
They that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved: * but I have trusted in thy mercy.
        
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: * yea, I will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.
        
      

    
  

    
  

      

      
        
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
        
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.
        
      

    
  

    
  
## Prayer
  
      
      
        
 Look down, we beseech thee, O Lord, on this thy family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ did not hesitate to be delivered up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer the torment of the Cross.
        
      

    
  
_The conclusion is prayed silently._
      
  
      
      
        
 Who with thee liveth and reigneth, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. Amen.
